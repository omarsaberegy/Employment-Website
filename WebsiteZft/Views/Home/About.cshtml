<h2>About Us</h2>



<p>An employment website is a website that deals specifically with employment or careers. <br/>
    Many employment websites are designed to allow employers to post job requirements for<br/>
     a position to be filled and are commonly known as job boards.<br/>
     Other employment sites offer employer reviews, career and job-search advice, <br/>
    and describe different job descriptions or employers.<br/>
     Through a job website a prospective employee can locate 
    and fill out a job application <br/>or submit resumes over the Internet for the advertised position.</p>
